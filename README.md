# Python Intermediate Level Course

This is a 4 sessions course (~8h) in Python and a variety of PSL features.

## Prerequisites
* Know Python basics
* Python version >= 3.8 installed
* Visual Studio Code (or another IDE)

## Course Layout
1. Basics recap, Complex structures, Functional programming
2. Class basics, Unit tests, Special methods
3. Multithreading, Multiprocessing
4. Project development case study

## Notes
All course exercises are present in the py files. Because some exercises have the purpose of throwing errors, or waiting for threads to finish, running the entire files can lead to strange behaviours. Furthermore, tools such as sonarlint may emit warnings due to code repetition (this is maintained in the files for students to compare refactors and different phases of a same exercise/feature).
